Daily workflow : http://nakedstartup.com/2010/04/simple-daily-git-workflow


1.Make sure you are up to date before your start to work!
	git checkout master git pull


2.When we are working on issues or new version etc.... we branch
	git checkout -b your-branch-name-here
	This creates a new branch for you to start making you changes and switches you into it.

	Do your work here! The key thing to remember at this stage is to commit often, *really often* the smaller your commits the more you can undo any damage or later go back and see what you did. Whether its a change of layout of a single template or a single test passing commit it separately.

3. To get status of change file and stuff
	git status

4.To Add every files that as been worked on use
		git add .
		or 
		'git add your/filename/here'

5. How to commit !
	git commit -m "detailed message here"

6.Once your feature is complete or your bug is squashed it's time to bring the master branch up to date.
	git checkout master git merge your-branch-name-here

	and repreat

	 For your next feature or bug just create another new branch
